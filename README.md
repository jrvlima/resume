## Summary

With over 20 years of experience in technology, I specialize in automating and optimizing cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and software delivery. My expertise spans cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP, where I design and implement scalable, efficient, and secure solutions tailored to business needs.

I help companies streamline operations, accelerate deployments, and enhance system reliability by leveraging infrastructure automation, CI/CD best practices, and cloud-native architectures. My background in fullstack engineering, distributed systems, and digital transformation enables me to bridge the gap between development and infrastructure, ensuring seamless integration and optimized performance.

Beyond hands-on implementation, I bring a strategic mindset, continuously aligning technology with business goals to drive efficiency and innovation. Whether building a proof of concept, leading architecture discussions, or implementing automation frameworks, I thrive in solving complex challenges and delivering tangible value. My foundation in Computer Science, complemented by Software Engineering and Architecture studies, equips me to approach problems with a structured, forward-thinking methodology.

I’m always learning, adapting, and pushing boundaries to create robust, future-proof solutions. Companies working with me gain a proactive problem-solver, a dedicated technologist, and a strategic partner committed to long-term success.
